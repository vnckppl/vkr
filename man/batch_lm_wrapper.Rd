\title{Run batch_lm and subsquently batch_lm_fdr on a number of predictor and
outcome variables.}
\usage{
batch_lm_wrapper(
  df,
  outcomes,
  predictors,
  covariates = NULL,
  numdec = 2,
  np = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame}

\item{outcomes}{Outcome measure(s) to loop over}

\item{predictors}{Predictor(s) to loop over}

\item{covariates}{Single covariate or array of covariates}

\item{numdec}{Number of decimals for the beta and std statistics}

\item{np}{If set with two values (Ca and maxIter), the code will run lmp,
from the lmPerm package, i.e., fitting and testing linear models with
permutation tests. Ca=Stop iterations when estimated standard error of the
estimated p is less than Ca*p. maxIter=The maximum number of iterations.}

\item{verbose}{Set to TRUE if you want to see the full lm output}
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper script for batch_lm to loop over a number of
predcitor and outcome variables, and to subsequently apply FDR correction on
the output using batch_lm_fdr.
